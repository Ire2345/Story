Once upon a time in a forest. There lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree. The tree was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife...

One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some berries.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them. As these days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.

One day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits and loved them, but she was jealous too.
This was because she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy,
I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart will be!" Then she said, "Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not 
willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
