Once upon a time in a forest. There lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree. The tree was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife...

One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some berries.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them. As these days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.



The monkey wanted to make a cloth for himself using crocodile skin. After a few days when the crocodile came to meet the monkey and have some berries,
the monkey tried to poison the crocodile.
